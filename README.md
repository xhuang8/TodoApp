## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

some instructions about my TodoApp: 

when the users open the TodoApp, they can see the todo list window which includes all the tasks users have made before. Also, users can mark the tasks to done, and users will see the color become gray and with "☑️" for marking. It means that this task was already done. Next, users can slide the tasks to left, and there will be two options which is edit and delete. The delete for removing the teaks if users don't want that, but edit for editing the task users want to change. After changing and saving, users will see a new changes about previous tasks. Then, users want to add a new task, they just press the button of the upper right corner of navigation bar, users will enter a new interface and choose to add a new task or cancel. If users add a new task and click "add", it will navigate to a todo list window.
